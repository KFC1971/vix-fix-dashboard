# Next Steps: Push to GitHub

Your settings in the screenshot are **Perfect**! (Keeping the repo empty is correct).

1.  Click the Green **Create repository** button.
2.  On the next page, copy the 3 lines under **"…or push an existing repository from the command line"**.
3.  Paste them into your terminal here.

It should look something like this:

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/KFC1971/vix-fix-dashboard.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

4.  After that is done, go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/) to deploy.
